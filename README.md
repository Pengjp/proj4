EECS 281 Project 4
# Overview
Amazon.com in recent times announced their new delivery method, Amazon Prime Air, where
Amazon allows 30 min delivery to a customer’s doorstep by means of a flying drone. You are
joining a company called EECS in the new drone tech space to compete with Amazon and its
drones. EECS will be providing clients with their own drone and routing technology for quick
delivery on campuses, either corporate or educational, amongst the campus facilities.
There are two types of drones at EECS:
Drone Type I is a drone that moves ten times as fast as the drones from their Amazon
counterpart. However, these drones require drone director beacon installations along the
path. The cost of these installations are directly proportional to the distance of the desired
path.
Drone Type II is a regular drone similar to their Amazon counterpart. The drone’s energy
usage is directly proportional to the distance it travels.
There are currently three types of clients (A, B, and C) that are interested in your drones, and
your task will vary based on the client type. This is described further in detail below.
To be clear, these scenarios are separate: your program will create a plan for one or
the other, but not both in the same run (although you may find that the algorithms from one
scenario may help with another).
